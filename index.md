## About Me
---

I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering) co-advised by [Prof. Peng Bai](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/peng-bai) and [Prof. Wei Fan](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/wei-fan). My work focuses on using artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques to accelerate materials discovery for targeted applications, from small molecules and polymers to crystal materials, in order to address critical challenges such as resource scarcity, energy crises, and environmental pollution. It involves a collaboration between computer science, machine learning, and computational chemical engineering. 

Outside of the lab, my hobbies include cooking, and hanging out with my cat [Yuebing](./assets/img/yuebing.jpg).
